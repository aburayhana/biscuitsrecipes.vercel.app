recipeingredient:
- " topping"
- "2 tbsp butter melted"
- "1 pinch of garlic powder"
- "1/2 tbsp Mrs Dash Garlic  Herb Seasoning"
- " biscuit"
- "1 cup shredded cheddar cheese"
- "1 cup milk"
- "1/4 cup cold butter cut into small pieces"
- "2 cup selfrising flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "preheat oven to 425°F"
- "add cold butter pieces to flour, cut into flour until crumbly (I start with a pastry cutter, but then use my hands, and just rub the butter and flour between my fingers)"
- "add 1/2 C milk, mix together, adding more milk if needed, until mixture pulls from side of bowl and sticks together"
- "add cheese, mix well (it&#39;s easier to mix this in with your hands to be sure the cheese is evenly distributed) keep mixing until all/most of cheese sticks in dough, instead of falling back into bowl"
- "roll dough out flat, approximately 1/2 - 3/4 inches thick"
- "cut biscuits from dough, either using biscuit cutter or an upturned glass, repeat steps 5 &amp; 6 until theres only enough dough left for one biscuit, shape by hand &amp; add to others (this one will be the ugly- I mean, &#39;rustic&#39; biscuit, lol)"
- "place cut biscuits on baking sheet about 1&#34; apart, bake until tops are nicely browned (this took approximately 12 minutes in my oven)"
- "while biscuits are baking, add topping ingredients together in a bowl, stirring well. (this should smell VERY garlicky, and ingredients can be adjusted more or less to your taste)"
- "once biscuits are done, remove from oven and immediately brush tops of biscuits with garlic butter mixture, repeating until it&#39;s gone. (make sure you get the herby bits from the bottom of the bowl while brushing! don&#39;t leave them behind!)"
- "as soon as they&#39;re cool enough to handle, eat &amp; enjoy!"
- "Notes: *this recipe is great for people with egg allergies!  - - *even the two pickiest eaters in the house loved these, so they should be a hit as long as garlic isn&#39;t a problem ;-)"
- "Caution: if your family loves biscuits, or you&#39;re serving more than 4, you might want to double (or triple) this recipe... I got 9 biscuits from this, and with 3 adults eating, we only had 2 left!"
- "Notes II: I adapted this recipe from a recipe I found on the King Arthur Flour website for plain Self-Rising Flour Biscuits."
