- "After your last rolling and folding, you can roll out to cut. Roll dough out so it&#39;s 1/2 inch or 12mm thick. Cut into 4-6 squares with a knife, or cut out rounds with the rime of a glass, etc. (I made a little extra so the pictures shows more)"
- "Have your oven preheated to 400째F/200째C. Bake for 20-30 minutes until tops are golden brown. (Mine only took 20 minutes so keep an eye on them!)"
