recipeingredient:
- " Biscuit Batter"
- "2 cups all purpose flour"
- "4 tsp. baking powder"
- "2 tsp. dried parsley"
- "3/4 tsp. salt"
- "3/4 tsp. garlic powder"
- "1/4 cup frozen butter grated"
- "1 1/2 cup cold buttermilk"
- "1 heaping cup freshly shredded cheddar cheese"
- " Buttery Topping"
- "3 tbsp. unsalted butter melted"
- "1/8 tsp. each salt garlic powder"
- "1/4 tsp. dried parsley"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven to 400°F. Line a large baking pan with parchment paper and set it aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, parsley, salt and garlic powder. Then use a fork or pastry cutter to cut in the frozen, grated butter until it resembles small peas."
- "Fold in the buttermilk, then the shredded cheese until just combined. Careful not to overmix the batter or your biscuits will be dense. Use either a medium sized cookie scoop or two large spoons to drop the batter onto the baking pan, keeping an inch or two of space between them, as they will expand a bit in the oven."
- "Bake for 10-15 minutes (depends how big you make them and how hot your oven runs), until golden brown on the bottom and the tops are starting to crisp up a bit. While they are baking, whisk together the ingredients for the buttery topping in a small bowl and set them aside. Once the biscuits are done, immediately brush them with the buttery mixture and serve them warm."
