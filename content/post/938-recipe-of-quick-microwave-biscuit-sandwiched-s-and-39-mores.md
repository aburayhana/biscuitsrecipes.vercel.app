- " Marie Biscuits"

recipeinstructions:
- "Align the biscuits on the turn table of your microwave. Place one marshmallow on each of them."
- "Microwave on HIGH for 15 seconds for each round. I have used a 1250 watts Microwave. The time might differ a little in others but that is nearly negligible. So there is nothing much to worry. They get done in a jiffy."
- "After done with marshmallows, place 2 pieces of the dark chocolate on top of each."
- "Microwave again for 15 seconds. The only thing to be kept in mind is that the chocolate should be at room temperature so that it melts easily giving that gooey texture to the luscious S&#39;mores."
- "Place a biscuit on top and press a little. That&#39;s it guys! The delicious S&#39;mores Sandwiched Biscuits are all ready to be devoured."
