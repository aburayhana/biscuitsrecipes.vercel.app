- "Use fingers to squish butter into the flour, until it forms about pea-size chunks (the chunks are important!)."

- "After rolling out the second time, fold in three again, re-wrap with plastic and chill in fridge for another hour."
- "Remove from refrigerator and repeat the roll-out, fold, roll-out, fold process. You can now roll them out to cut and bake OR if you want even MORE flaky layers, refrigerate for an additional hour, then roll-fold, roll-fold one last time."
- "After your last rolling and folding, you can roll out to cut. Roll dough out so it&#39;s 1/2 inch or 12mm thick. Cut into 4-6 squares with a knife, or cut out rounds with the rime of a glass, etc. (I made a little extra so the pictures shows more)"
- "Have your oven preheated to 400째F/200째C. Bake for 20-30 minutes until tops are golden brown. (Mine only took 20 minutes so keep an eye on them!)"
