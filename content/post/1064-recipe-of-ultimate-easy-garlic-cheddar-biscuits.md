As far as the cheese, I grate approx. half of a 1lb. brick, so I&#39;m really not sure of cup equivalent, but it&#39;s to your liking anyway, so be creative, have fun and enjoy cooking, just as much as you enjoy eating!!!!!"
- "These are not healthy diet biscuits, well not the way I make them. I don&#39;t eat them a lot, so I have fun when I do..."
