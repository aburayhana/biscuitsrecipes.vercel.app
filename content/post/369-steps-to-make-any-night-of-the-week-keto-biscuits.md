- "Scoop the dough onto the baking sheet."
- "These bad boys only take 15-20 minutes to bake. If you&#39;re like me and going through withdrawals or speaking in tongues while on this Keto diet during the first phase, you will turn the light on the oven and watch these things bake like I did. Yes, I stood there staring at these for 20 minutes without moving. Sad, but in my self-defense, I do have a day job aside from this."
