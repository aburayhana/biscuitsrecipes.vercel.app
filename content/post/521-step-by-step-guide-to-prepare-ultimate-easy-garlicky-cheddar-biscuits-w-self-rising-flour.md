- "while biscuits are baking, add topping ingredients together in a bowl, stirring well. (this should smell VERY garlicky, and ingredients can be adjusted more or less to your taste)"
- "once biscuits are done, remove from oven and immediately brush tops of biscuits with garlic butter mixture, repeating until it&#39;s gone. (make sure you get the herby bits from the bottom of the bowl while brushing! don&#39;t leave them behind!)"

- "Notes: *this recipe is great for people with egg allergies!  - - *even the two pickiest eaters in the house loved these, so they should be a hit as long as garlic isn&#39;t a problem ;-)"
- "Caution: if your family loves biscuits, or you&#39;re serving more than 4, you might want to double (or triple) this recipe... I got 9 biscuits from this, and with 3 adults eating, we only had 2 left!"
- "Notes II: I adapted this recipe from a recipe I found on the King Arthur Flour website for plain Self-Rising Flour Biscuits."
