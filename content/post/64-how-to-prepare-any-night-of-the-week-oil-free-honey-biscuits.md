recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 120℃."
- "Put the pancake mix and honey into a bowl and knead."
- "If the dough does not come together, adjust by adding water. (Though, it should come together as you knead, so add only a small amount.)"
- "Place the dough on a sheet of plastic wrap. Cover it with another sheet and roll it out with a rolling pin until 2-3 mm thick. If it&#39;s sticky, chill in the fridge."
- "Cut out the dough with a cookie cutter, and poke holes with a fork. Bake for 30 minutes in a 120℃ oven."
- "When baked, let sit in the oven for a while. Wait until it&#39;s cooled enough to the touch, and it&#39;s done."
- "Note: These biscuits turn out relatively hard. Please be careful when serving small children or someone with weak teeth."
- "Note 2: When adding the honey, start with 1 scant tablespoon and check if you need some more. If you add too much, the dough will stay soft and will not harden even if you bake it for a longer time."
