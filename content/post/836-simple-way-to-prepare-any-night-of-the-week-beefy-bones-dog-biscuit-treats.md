recipeingredient:
- " Wholemeal Flour Or 3 Cups Plain Flour"
- " Large Eggs"
- " Bisto Gravy"
- " Shredded Beef"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by shredding or cutting up the beef as finely as you can until you have about 1 Cup of shredded beef, I use any leftovers of roast beef as this shreds really easily. If you will be using roast beef, you may wish to collect some of the raw blood to mix in with the gravy later to create a richer, meatier flavour."
- "Preheat the oven to 160c for a fan oven or 180c for a conventional oven."
- "In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, eggs and gravy to create your basic biscuit. Once combined pour in the shredded beef and mix in thoroughly. For best results use an electric stand mixer with the dough hook attachment."
- "Once you are happy with your dough, transfer to a floured surface and with a floured rolling pin, rollout the dough to about a 1/4 inch thick and cut into your desired shape."
- "Place the biscuits onto a tray lined with greaseproof paper and place in the oven for 15 minutes."
- "Allow to cool completely before feeding to your dog no matter how much they may beg!"
